### Lending Club Loan Data Analysis


### Limitation of current research
1. The analysis is based on the customer database of the company “Lending Club”, which might contain bias as it could not represent features of all loan transactions in the US. 
2. Current research shows concentration in geographic of users, which may cause bias.
3. Lack of evidence about independency between variables while doing correlation analysis.

### Hypothesis
1. The borrowers using Lending Club have worse economic situations(lower annual income, income/debt ratio, asset/debt ratio) than borrowers from all other lenders.
2. The DTI (debt to income ratio) has negative correlations to the number of years that the applicant is in the job.
3. People with higher annual incomes are more likely to make repayments on time.
